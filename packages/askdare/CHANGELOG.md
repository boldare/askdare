# @boldare/askdare

## 0.1.0-rc.0

### Minor Changes

- da333a2: First release of askdare: an AI chat for any website, served by your Next.js app and built on the official OpenAI SDK (Responses and Conversations APIs). It succeeds `@boldare/openai-assistant`, which stopped working when OpenAI shut down the Assistants API.
  
  - **Integration:** a bot in `askdare.config.ts` (`defineBot`), one catch-all route (`createChatHandler`) and one script tag on any website (`widget.js?bot=<id>`). `npx @boldare/askdare init` sets it up, and `npx @boldare/askdare doctor` checks the key, models, vector store, headers and allowed sites, locally or deployed.
  - **Embedding:** a small loader and an isolated iframe served by your app, shown only on the sites in `security.allowedOrigins`. As a bubble, behind your own button (`data-launcher="none"`) or inside the page (`data-mode="inline"`), driven by `askdare('open' | 'close' | 'toggle' | 'configure' | 'identify')`.
  - **No database:** conversations live in OpenAI's Conversations API, and the browser keeps an encrypted resume token. Visitors can start a new conversation, which deletes the old one and its files.
  - **Knowledge base:** `npx @boldare/askdare kb sync <folder>` mirrors your documents to a vector store, and answers cite your pages.
  - **Tools:** `defineTool` with Zod schemas, validated arguments, timeouts and output limits. Tools see only verified context.
  - **Attachments and voice:** images and PDFs (checked by their bytes, re-encoded in the browser, referenced by encrypted handles), and dictation into the message field.
  - **Signed-in visitors:** `askdare('identify', token)` with a JWT your backend signs.
  - **Safety and cost:** short-lived encrypted sessions; rate limits; daily token and speech budgets per visitor, IP, bot and app, reserved per model call; a kill switch; sanitized Markdown; no cookies; no message content in logs; `onError` for your monitoring. In development, the chat and the log say what is wrong with the setup.
  - **Look:** four themes (Aura, Halo, Sage, Care) in light and dark, your own with `defineTheme`, `--ask-*` tokens and `data-ask-part` parts for your CSS, English and Polish texts with overrides for every key, and an AI disclosure. Keyboard, focus and screen reader support, checked with axe.
  - **Docs in the package:** the guides (`docs/`), `llms.txt` and a skill for AI coding agents (`skills/askdare`), always matching the installed version.
  
  For limits shared across several server instances, add `@boldare/askdare-upstash`.
